# Low Usage AWS Utility(LUAU)
LUAU is a plug-n-play suite of lambdas that aims to minimize the cost of operations of amazon account by acting upon Trusted Advisor(TA) recommendations.

## How it works?
LUAU utilizes amazon's tagging system to create a framework that can alert users about their unececessary expenditure and help act upon them.

## Package Structure

```
├── bin
├── mailer
├── resources
├── tagger
│   └── parser
├── test
│   ├── example_events
│   └── tagger_test
└── util
```

**bin**: Contains build/deploy scripts    
**mailer**: Will contain the Lambda function(s) responsible for processing Trusted Advisor data and emailing out the Low Use reports    
**resources**: This contains configuration files used in the build/deploy processes. Right now it only contains the SAM template for the tagger.   
**tagger**: This contains the Lambda functions responsible for auto-tagging AWS resources. Currently tags EC2, ASG, EBS, AMI, and Security Groups. This package also contains a parser subpackage used to parse the event data.     
**test**: Where the tests go. Each Python package will have it's own test package called [package_name]_test. This also contains a folder with example event data for the events we want to handle.     
**util**: This is a Python package that will contain utility modules that can be shared by the other packages. This includes things like AWS calls.
